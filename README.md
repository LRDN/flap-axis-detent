Flap Axis Detent
================

[FlyWithLua](https://github.com/X-Friese/FlyWithLua) plugin script for the X-Plane flight simulator which changes the default behavior of the flap axis by automatically adding linear detents based on the aircraft in use and smoothing the overall input.

Configuration
-------------

1. Copy `flap-axis-detent.lua` to the FlyWithLua scripts directory
2. Assign an axis to use for flaps in the X-Plane preferences
3. Reload your aircraft or start a new flight

Please note that the script removes the flap axis setting from your configuration. This is expected behavior and required to avoid interference. You only need to reassign the flap axis when changing input devices.
